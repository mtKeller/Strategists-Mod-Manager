**MAKE SURE ONLY ONE MOD NEXUS IS OPEN AT A TIME IF ONE IS OPEN THEN FOCUS ON IT ***
IN IPCMAIN ADD IN BLOCKER FOR WHEN A MOD IS BEING MODIFIED AND INCLUDE A FILTER 

TO GET FILES FROM MAPPED DIRS LOOK FOR PATH THAT HAS A . THEN LOOP DOWN TILL YOU GET A /
CREATE PATHS IF THEY DONT EXIST

REMEMBER TO TEST ADM ZIP
<!-- ALSO TO ADD IN PREPARED OR NOT -->
<!-- 
Work on if file exists write, to save flow. Mod folder, NativePC, appState.json
Break off into seperate -->

Then unpacking zip, rar into mods/temp/ to process handle mod load order.
Unzip -> Map -> Check paths -> Take ownership -> Overwrite -> Delete Temp
Figure out a means to do this dynamically for load order
<!-- WRITE UNZIP -->
Off load UNZIP to SHARP COMPRESS
WRITE UNRAR
WRITE UN7ZIP
FIND LIST FUNCTION TO AVOID FIRST UNPACK

CREATE TRIGGER TO LIST
TEST WITH DUMMY PATHS VIA UNZIP
DOES NOT SUPPORT RAR 7ZIP TILL UPDATE
THEN ONCE THERE ARE PATHS
FIGURE OUT 

<!-- WORK ON DIR WATCH -->
<!-- CREATE A ACTION_CHAIN THAT TRIGGERS EVERY EMIT ON NATIVEPC -->
CREATE MOD SCHEME BY FINDING BEST END PATH FOR THAT CATEGORY THEN FILTERING PATHS
    MONSTERS
    QUESTS
    ARMOR
    EFFECTS
    ETC
THEN USE THAT TO CREATE A MOD LIST
    AGGREGATED THE SAME WAY YOU MAPPED THE DIRS
    PER MOD CATEGORY FILTER ONLY THOSE PATHS
    AND MAKE ADD THOSE TO A CLASS MOD LIST
DISABLED MODS ARE PACKED INTO RARS IN CUSTOM MOD PATH
NEW MODS GO THERE AS WELL
DO NOT DELETE UNLESS ASKED
RELY ON DIR WATCH TO UPDATE AND TRIGGER MOD STATE TOGGLED
EACH MOD HAS A LOAD ORDER BY INDEX
THIS IS STORED IN THAT MODS JSON
ALONG WITH AUTHOR INFO + IMAGES
EDITABLE FROM LAUNCHER
GENERATES A DEFAULT JSON IF NONE WERE FOUND WITH NAME FROM CATEGORY
IF MULTIPLE MODS HAVE THE SAME TITLE, THEY ARE GROUPED INTO ONE MOD
THUS MOD LIST IS A ARRAY MANIFEST POINTING TO EACH MOD INCLUDED BY MOD_NAME
    MOD_LIST {
        mods: [
                {
                    PATH: [string],
                    DATA: [JSON],
                    //REST ARE COPIED FROM DATA
                    //STARTS OFF AS ONE PATH DATA
                    //THEN REDUCES REDUCES IN LOOP TILL NO PAIRS FOUND
                    //RETURNS CONSOLIDATED MOD LIST
                    AUTHOR: string,
                    CATEGORY: string = determined by FILTER
                    MOD_TITLE: string,
                    VERSION: DATE,
                    IMAGES: [pathToImage],
                    enabled: boolean
                }
            ]
    };
**** WHICH MEANS SAVE LOAD ACTION_CHAIN NEEDS TO BE WORKING FOR MAIN STATE FOR SAME WORKFLOW *****

REMEMBER TO CODE IN A LOADING OVERLAY FOR THIS SHIT

FIGURE OUT INSTALLER

CREATE EASY MEANS OF DOWNLOADING STUFF OFF OF MOD NEXUS

ADD IN TOOL BUTTON AND TOOL CATEGORIES
    MODDING TOOLS
    GRAPHICS

THEN CREATE MONSTER VARIATIONS MOD FINALLY

ngIF CATEGORY === MONSTER

THINK ABOUT QUEST WEAPON AND ARMOR HOOKS
REALLY NEED A ACTION API FOR MEMORY READS AND INJECTION
ABILITY TO CHANGE OUT SPECIFIC ARMOR PIECES ONLY IF YOU GOT THE DROPS IN LAUNCHER
